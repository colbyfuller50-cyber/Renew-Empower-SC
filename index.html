    <h2>Our Message</h2>
    <article class="speech-text">
      <p>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
      <p>As I stand before you today, I do so not only as a candidate for the South Carolina House of Representatives but as a proud South Carolinian, a dedicated public servant, and an Air Force veteran who has had the honor of serving our country in Operation Inherent Resolve.</p>
      <p>My journey took me from the proud skies over Iraq, defending our nation's freedom, to standing here with a mission to serve and uplift our community back home. My service in the Air Force, especially during a tour in Iraq, taught me about the values of courage, integrity, and dedication—values that I pledge to bring to the forefront of my campaign and, if elected, to the halls of our state government.</p>
      <p>Our campaign, “Renew & Empower SC,” is a reflection of these values. It's about renewing our commitment to the principles that make South Carolina a place we're proud to call home. It's about empowering each and every resident to achieve their fullest potential through innovative solutions and steadfast leadership.</p>
      <h3>Economic Development</h3>
      <p>As someone who has served to protect the American dream, I understand the importance of supporting small and medium-sized enterprises. They are the backbone of our economy. Our mission is to foster an environment where businesses can thrive, creating jobs and opportunities for our citizens.</p>
      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>My commitment to service didn't end overseas. It extends to ensuring our children have access to quality education. We must prepare them for the challenges of tomorrow with improved STEM programs and vocational training, building a brighter future for all.</p>
      <h3>Healthcare</h3>
      <p>Access to healthcare is a right that should be afforded to every South Carolinian. We will work tirelessly to expand healthcare services, especially in our rural communities.</p>
      <h3>Infrastructure and Environment</h3>
      <p>Logistics and planning expertise from the military inform my approach to infrastructure and environmental stewardship. We must invest in sustainable development to protect our beautiful state for future generations.</p>
      <h3>Community Safety</h3>
      <p>We will strengthen law enforcement partnerships, advance community policing, and address root causes of crime to ensure safe streets for all.</p>
      <p>Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the great state of South Carolina.</p>
